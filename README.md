# Titanic Survival Prediction Project

**Goal:**
Use the Titanic dataset to build a model that predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not.

**Project Overview:**
The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone on board, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.

This project involves using the Titanic dataset to build a model that predicts the survival of passengers. The dataset typically includes information about individual passengers, such as:
- Age
- Gender
- Ticket class
- Fare
- Cabin
- Whether or not they survived

**Steps:**
1. Data Preprocessing:
   - Clean the data by handling missing values.
   - Encode categorical features.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis:
   - Analyze the distribution of features.
   - Identify correlations between features and survival.
3. Model Building:
   - Train various machine learning models.
   - Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics.
4. Visualization:
   - Create visualizations to showcase insights and model predictions.

**Skills Demonstrated:**
This project showcases your ability to work with datasets, build predictive models, and present findings through visualizations.
# HR Data Analysis Project

**Goal:**
Conduct HR data analysis to clean and prepare the data for further insights and decision-making.

**Activities to Complete:**
- Data cleansing involves removing unnecessary columns.

- Eliminating the dataset's NaN values.
- Making additional necessary changes.

**Steps:**
1. Remove unnecessary columns.
2. Rename columns to more meaningful names.
3. Eliminate redundant entries.
4. Sanitize specific columns to ensure data consistency.
5. Eliminate NaN values from the dataset.
6. Make any additional changes as needed to clean the data.

**Skills Demonstrated:**
This project showcases your ability to clean and preprocess HR data, demonstrating proficiency in data handling and preparation for further analysis.
# Sales Data Analysis Project
